# Graphics Engine
C++ 3D graphics engine with no external libraries.  
    loads and renders .obj files.

### Motivation
I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how computer graphics engines like OpenGL work under the hood, both from a programming and mathematical perspective. 
By building a 3D renderer in C++, I'll hopefully be able to deeply understand fundamental graphics concepts such as rasterization, shading, and texture mapping.

### Results
1) 3D model loading and wireframe rendering (2/11/2025)
